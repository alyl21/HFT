# HFT
high frequency trading
The code provided is a Python implementation of an advanced High-Frequency Trading (HFT) algorithm that incorporates limit and market orders and implements an order matching algorithm for improved efficiency.
The code starts by importing the necessary Python modules - random for generating random numbers, Queue for implementing a queue data structure, threading for implementing multi-threading, and time for measuring time intervals.
There are two functions in the code:
buy(quantity, order_type): This function is used to place a buy order. It takes in two parameters, quantity (the quantity to be bought) and order_type (either "limit" or "market" order). If the order type is "market", the function attempts to execute the order immediately by matching it with a sell order in the sell_queue. If no sell orders are available, the function places a limit order in the buy_queue. If the order type is "limit", the function simply places the order in the buy_queue.
sell(quantity, order_type): This function is used to place a sell order. It takes in two parameters, quantity (the quantity to be sold) and order_type (either "limit" or "market" order). If the order type is "market", the function attempts to execute the order immediately by matching it with a buy order in the buy_queue. If no buy orders are available, the function places a limit order in the sell_queue. If the order type is "limit", the function simply places the order in the sell_queue.
In the code provided, there are two main risk management strategies implemented, as well as support for limit orders. Here is a description of each:
Risk Management Strategies:
The HFT algorithm implements two risk management strategies:
a. If the price of the symbol drops below 0, the algorithm will print a message indicating that the price has dropped too low and will exit the program. This is done to prevent the algorithm from continuing to execute trades at a loss.
b. If a market order cannot be executed within 1 second, the algorithm will place a limit order instead. This is done to prevent the algorithm from executing trades at unfavorable prices, which can occur when market conditions change rapidly or when the market is illiquid. By placing a limit order instead of a market order, the algorithm can ensure that the order is executed at a specific price or better, rather than at the current market price.
Limit Orders:
The HFT algorithm also supports limit orders. If a user specifies a limit order when placing a buy or sell order, the algorithm will place the order in the appropriate queue and wait for a matching order to become available. Once a matching order is found, the algorithm will execute the trade at the specified limit price or better. If no matching order is found within a specified time period, the algorithm will cancel the limit order and return the remaining quantity to the user.
In summary, the HFT algorithm implements both risk management strategies and limit orders to help ensure that trades are executed at favorable prices and to help prevent losses in the event of adverse market conditions.
